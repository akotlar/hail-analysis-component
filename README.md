# Sample QC
This component removes samples that are apparent mixtures, determined by having a high Watterson estimator of theta (a value larger than .0015 and at least 3 S.D above sample mena) together with a high heterozygote/homozygote ratio (a value greater than 2.5, and 3 S.D above sample mean).
